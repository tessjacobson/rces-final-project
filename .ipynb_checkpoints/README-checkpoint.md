# rces-final-project
For my final RCES project, I will be analyzing the weather and climate anomalies that contributed to the record-breaking 2018 wildfire season in the North American West using [ERA-Interim](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era-interim) reanalysis data and a [burned-area dataset](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod45.php) for reference.

### Analysis plan
I will be visualizing seasonal anomalies in several climatic factors for the year preceding the 2018 fire season, using the monthly climatology of the 1979-2019 period. I plan to look at precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture, temperature, winds at 10km, 700mb, and 200mb, vertical velocity at 700mb, and vapor pressure deficit. For some of these variables, it will be useful to standardize the anomalies by dividing by their standard deviations. After describing the large-scale dynamical environment in the year leading up to this extreme fire season, I can look at the larger global domain to examine the origins of this atmospheric circulation anomaly, and possibly extend this project to see if this sequence of anomalies is typical of other high fire autumns in the North American West.
